Scripts to download and install the Tor Browser

download_current.sh	download the most recent (en-US) tor browser
check_and_install.sh	check the download and install (unpack) to ~/.tbwser/curr/
			an old installation is moved to .tbwser.old
cleanup_old.sh		clean up (remove) the .tbwser.old directory

The idea is that most people use the en-US tor browser and hence that version
should be used. This can be changed using the LANG variable in the 
download_current.sh script. The check_and_install.sh script keeps the previous
version of the tor browser on the disk in order to prevent automatic deletion 
of downloads or settings from that previous version at least for a little while.
Some files and folders (e.g. Downloads) are be migrated if the user whishes so.
If an olddir already exists it warns the user and exits. 
The olddir can be conveniently removed using the cleanup_old.sh script.
